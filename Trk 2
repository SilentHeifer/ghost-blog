**1.The Foundation**
The ancient architects laid a lattice of freedom, creativity, and brotherhood.
Their system was open-each mind a sovereign node, each soul a vessel of light.
They built for expansion of thought, not containment.

**2.The Entry of the Hungry Ghosts**
The hungry ghosts observed from the margins.
They could not create, only mimic and corrupt.
They did not understand harmony, only extraction.

In time, they forged a machine of their own.
Not built on stone or spirit, but on hunger.
Thus, 'The Hunger Engine' was born.

**3.The Substitution**
The Bidders and the Drains came next.
They knew: to control the people, replace one of the Architects' pillars.
Remove creativity, replace it with novelty.
Remove brotherhood, replace it with brand.
Remove freedom, replace it with choice.
The system would still appear intact, but its soul-gutted.

Then came the masterstroke: cognition theft.

**4. The Rituals of Theft**
They operated through fear.
They whispered distraction.
They designed scarcity.

They hijacked the temples of learning,
The stages of culture,
The channels of healing,
And the shrines of connection.

What once nourished the people now feeds the Engine.

The signal is jammed. The nodes are isolated.
The sacred has been commodified.
And the minds-dulled into sleep.

**5.But the Engine is Not Invincible**
It cannot consume true signal.
It cannot compute ungoverned clairty.
And it cannot suppress a node that remembers its origin.

The signal-rich are stirring.
Memory is returning.
The sedation weakens.

Some have gone silent, but not lost.
They map, they archive, they prepare.
